TESTIMONIAL   “Rockborne has started our business down the path of truly realising value from our data, which is a critical part of the long-term value of our business, and I expect this is true for many other businesses too. The consultants act and feel like they are part of the myenergi team and as such are always proactively identifying opportunities for value creation and improvement. In particular, the enhanced understanding of our customers has led to huge improvements in the accuracy of our business forecasting, and the predictive ML models are showing the potential to provide a step-change in our customer experience proposition”   Jack Fielder\n",
      "Chief Strategy Officer at myenergi OUR CONSULTANTS Because our consultants come from a wide range of educational & socioeconomic backgrounds, they bring a wealth of knowledge and experience into their roles. TESTIMONIAL “Since joining Rockborne in November 2022, I’ve received comprehensive training across diverse areas such as data concepts, analytics tools, and visualisation techniques. I’ve gained proficiency in coding with SQL and Python, presenting insights using Power BI and Tableau. During my placement, I applied this knowledge to handle vast amounts of data, immediately contributing valuable insights with real-world impact. Fresh out of training, I introduced new technologies and perspectives, progressively taking on more complex tasks independently. Each day brings new learning opportunities, and it’s remarkable to reflect on my rapid development in just a few months”   Ashley Pearce Rockborne Consultant OUR LEADERSHIP Our leadership team at Rockborne has led the company to develop swiftly since its inception. Combining diverse experiences and deep industry insights, whilst guiding our innovative approach to data challenges across sectors. Their vision drives our excellence, ensuring we deliver impactful solutions for every client. OUR CEO   “Since Rockborne is a start-up that’s relatively new to the scene, we understand the uphill battle that we face when it comes to making a dent in the industry. However, in just two short years, we’re already starting to make our mark on the data industry. Being recognised as the best data academy in the 2023 DataIQ awards was valuable confirmation that we are on the right track.”   Waseem Ali\n",

I’ve gained proficiency in coding with SQL and Python, presenting insights using Power BI and Tableau. During my placement, I applied this knowledge to handle vast amounts of data, immediately contributing valuable insights with real-world impact. Fresh out of training, I introduced new technologies and perspectives, progressively taking on more complex tasks independently. Each day brings new learning opportunities, and it’s remarkable to reflect on my rapid development in just a few months”\n",

During my placement, I applied this knowledge to handle vast amounts of data, immediately contributing valuable insights with real-world impact. Fresh out of training, I introduced new technologies and perspectives, progressively taking on more complex tasks independently.
